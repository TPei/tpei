### Hi there 👋

I'm a Full-Stack Developer with a Master's in Computer Science from TU Berlin.

I am especially interested in the architectural challenges of distributed web systems and current patterns and technologies that aim at alleviating some of the challenges that come with designing and operating complex distributed systems. This was a driving factor in my motivation to write my Bachelor's Thesis on Microservice Architecture.

I'm passionate about making the world a little better, especially through mindfulness, sustainability and privacy enhancing technologies. This led to my Master's Thesis about "Purpose-based Access Control in Function as a Service Environments".

I'm currently at Gapfish, where I mainly work with Ruby on Rails, REST APIs and Kubernetes and I also lead a meditation group twice a week.

My summary:
- 🗺️ Berlin based software developer
- 🛠 Mostly working on Ruby-based Backends
- 🌱 Side projects with Vue.js, Crystal and Serverless
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Passionate about team culture, team building and making work a safe and fun place to be
- 🧘 Mindfulness, Bouldering, Climbing
- 🎓 MSc CS, Focus on Distributed Systems and Privacy-enhancing technologies
- 💻 Ubuntu, FOSS
