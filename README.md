### Hi there 👋

I'm Thomas, I'm CTO at horizoom.

I am especially interested in people and how they come together to build great products. This includes blockers we face in our daily lives as developers, the processes we come up with to overcome them, the personal challenges we face in our careers as developers and the human touch in our work.

On the tech side I'm especially interested in the architectural challenges of distributed web systems and current patterns and technologies that aim at alleviating some of the challenges that come with designing and operating complex distributed systems.

I hold a Bachelor's from FH Flensburg and a Master's from TU Berlin. My theses were about Microservices and Serverless Architectures.

My summary:
- 🗺️ Berlin based software developer
- 🛠 Mostly working on Ruby-based Backends
- 🌱 Side projects with Vue.js, Crystal and Serverless
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Passionate about team culture, team building and making work a safe and fun place to be
- 🧘 Mindfulness, Bouldering, Climbing
- 🎓 MSc CS, Focus on Distributed Systems and Privacy-enhancing technologies
